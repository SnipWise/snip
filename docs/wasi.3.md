# WASI: WebAssembly System Interface

## Why WASI Matters

With WASI, developers can compile languages like C, C++, or Rust to WebAssembly and run those modules on any platform that supports WASI, reusing code and reducing development effort. WASI ensures a secure, modular, and consistent API for interacting with the host system, unlocking new possibilities for cross-platform software distribution.[4][8][10]

## Example Use Cases

- Running server-side Wasm modules in cloud or edge environments.
- Portable plugins and extensions for desktop applications.
- Compiling legacy system tools to Wasm for modern deployment.[8][3]
