# WASI: WebAssembly System Interface

## Key Features

- **Standardized APIs:** WASI defines system-level operations for file I/O, networking, environment variables, clocks, randomness, and more.[6][8][3]
- **Security:** WASI is designed with capability-based security and does not grant modules ambient (default) access to resources; permissions must be explicitly provided.[5][13]
- **Portability:** WASI aims to make WebAssembly modules truly portable across operating systems and environments by providing a unified system interface.[10][13][3]
