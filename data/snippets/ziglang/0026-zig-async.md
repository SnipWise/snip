## Async (Experimental)
Asynchronous programming (note: async is experimental in Zig)
```zig
const std = @import("std");

// Note: Async/await is currently being redesigned in Zig
// This is a simplified example of what the syntax looks like

fn asyncFunction() callconv(.Async) u32 {
    return 42;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    // Simple example showing async frame concept
    var frame = async asyncFunction();
    const result = await frame;

    std.debug.print("Result: {d}\n", .{result});
}

// Note: For concurrent programming, Zig recommends using threads
// or the std.event.Loop for now while async is being redesigned
```
