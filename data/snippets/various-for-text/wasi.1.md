# WASI: WebAssembly System Interface

## Overview

WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) is a set of standardized APIs designed to grant WebAssembly (Wasm) programs secure and portable access to system resources, such as files, network sockets, or system clocks. WASI effectively bridges the gap between Wasm’s sandboxed environment and real-world system capabilities, making it possible for Wasm modules to run outside browsers—in servers, desktops, edge devices, and embedded systems—with consistent system access.[3][8][10]
